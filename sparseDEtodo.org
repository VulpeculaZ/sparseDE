* Applications

** More simulations:
*** More numbers of iterations
*** Change delay scheme.
    One delay
    Several consecutive delays.
*** Jun Zhu's paper on one iteration.

** lasso on grid simulations:
*** TODO lasso on grid for delays
*** TODO lasso on grid for tv

** TODO lasso tv for measles data

** TODO spline delays

** Longtime:
*** TODO HIV infection data
*** TODO High-dimensional genomic data
*** TODO High-dimensional google trend data.




* Theory:
** TODO Find paper about nls lasso
** TODO Profile the entire non-convex likelihood or posterior distribution.

** Limiting Property.
